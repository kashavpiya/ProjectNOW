                <h3>Supportive Housing Services:</h3>
                
                <p>Project NOW assists families and individuals connect to the information and services they need to keep their homes and apartments. Some of the ways we can help include helping customers connect to medical assistance, utility assistance and transportation assistance. Outreach workers/case workers work hand in hand with other community programs to help our customers get the help they need. Individuals or families who have already lost their homes, for instance, may be given the name and address of a local shelter(s) to take care of their most immediate need for housing.</p>
                
                <p>Project NOW also helps customers access Housing Authority/Rental Information. In some circumstances, customers may be directly assisted with a rental payment or deposit to ensure that they will be able to maintain their current living situation.</p>
                
                <p>As part of Project NOW's commitment to fighting and ending the conditions which cause homelessness, we are the lead agency in the Northwestern Illinois Continuum of Care. The Continuum, covering a region of fifteen (15) counties in Illinois, is comprised of housing, social service, and employment partners in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.</p>
