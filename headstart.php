                <p>Head Start promotes the school readiness of preschool-aged children from low-income families. Services are provided through two options: center-based and home-based in three counties: Rock Island, Henry, and Mercer. Head Start is provided at no cost to income eligible families with children 3-5 years old including children with disabilities or other special needs.</p>
                
                <p>Head Start offers a variety of services that support the children’s growth in positive learning environments: early learning and development, health, and family wellbeing. Our program engages parents and family members in positive relationships, focusing on the needs of the family. Parents participate in leadership roles through Policy Council and parent meetings, including having a say in program operations.</p>
                
                <p>Physical and dental examinations are needed to participate. Other screenings provided include hearing, vision, and developmental as well as social/emotional observations. Head Start staff assist families in securing medical and dental treatments, work with families to develop educational goals for their children, and to develop family goals. Head Start partners with local agencies and community partners for other resources as needed.</p>

                <h3>Parent Services</h3>
                <p>Project NOW Head Start partners with parents and families to provide comprehensive family support and school readiness experiences. At the start of each school year, an initial needs and strengths assessment is completed during a home visit with a Family Service Worker. Based on the family's individual needs, parents and staff set goals for the children and their families in the areas of:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Health and Nutrition</li><br>
                    <li>Early Childhood Education</li><br>
                    <li>Social-Emotional Growth</li><br>
                    <li>Physical Development</li><br>
                    <li>Parent Education</li><br>
                    <li>Social Services Needed</li><br>
                    <li>Parent Engagement</li><br>
                </ul>
                
                
                
                <p>An important part of this process is to link families to the many resources available in their communities. Project NOW provides many resources that they families may need.</p>
